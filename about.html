				I'm a writer, editor and communications buff based in Melbourne, Australia.
				<br>
				<br>
				I've edited a number of publications and freelanced for a few more. I've written across print and online, exploring all kinds of topics including food, travel, luxury fashion, health, history, science, the environment, and small business.
				<br>
				<br>
				I've also got seven years' marketing, PR and communications experience under my belt. I've created and executed PR and marketing campaigns, written press materials and copy for marketing collateral and websites, managed social media campaigns, and spoken at numerous events.
				<br>
				<br>
				I am available for freelance writing, editing, proofreading, PR, marketing and social media projects.
				<br>
				<br>
				Please get in touch if you'd like to see more of my work.
